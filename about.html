    <p><em>What's your favorite color?</em>
    </br>
    </br>
      I can recall being asked that a surprising number of times just in the past
      year never mind the whole 19 years I've been alive. And each time I never
      have a response. What is my favorite color? Honestly I'm not sure. My closet
      consists of mostly monotone combinations of black and whites, my rose gold
      iPhone is covered in a black case and even the lock screen has been filtered
      so that the bright red wall in the backdrop is now a dark grey. It's not
      that I don't like color, it's just that I never really think about it
      either. It's convenient not having to worry about walking around all day in
      clashing colors. I simply get dressed faster in the morning, the black case
      was the one most readily available to me, and the grey filter gives the
      photo a nice aesthetic.

      Perhaps its this lack of color that I recently noticed that has piqued my
      interest in color. I have a mustard colored coat that had been gathering
      dust in the closet for almost a year after I deemed it too bright despite
      only a few wears. I bought the coat because it's a beautiful color but
      somehow I had forgotten to appreciate that fact. I finally pulled it out
      again this fall and it gives me as much joy to put on now as my black jeans.
      Though I won't go as far as to say its like I'm seeing color for the first
      time, I have been considering them, dwelling on their taste, if you will.

      Color has a strong effect on us. Just look at the colorless dystopian
      utopias of Lois Lowry's <em>The Giver</em> and the film <em>Equals</em>, featuring
      the white clad Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult living and working in
      buildings of some nondescript shade of white or gray. Somehow the two so
      called utopians lack the very thing that makes life vibrant. Sure there are
      some beautiful scenes of the forest in <em>Equals</em> and Hoult's character
      draws up some amazing illustrations, but the government has done their best
      to remove what color and emotions they can from their citizens lives. When young Jonas
      first sees color in <em>The Giver</em> he is more perplexed than anything
      else. He doesn't even have a word for what he sees. He can only say at first
      that "the apple had changed." The world he lives in has no capacity for
      color or pain. The citizens choose instead to push all the memories of the
      past onto one man called The Giver. But with the pain goes the colors and joy,
      because without one, there are no others. Or consider the dull colored
      dystopians who don't pretend to be
      anything other than what they are, like Cormac McCarthy's relentlessly gray
      world of <em>The Road</em>. The only image of hope in this world is fire, red,
      one of the very few colors that do appear reapetedly, though sometimes in
      the form of blood. What other little color there is shows up mainly in
      memories of the past or in
      dreams, both places not of the desolate present. So we see that the
      repression of color makes for a bleak picture.
    </br>
    </br>
      Yet when we have color in abundance we seem to take it for granted, rarely
      consciously considering it. <a href="https://www.everlane.com" target="_blank">Everlane</a>,
      an online retailer that has quickly risen in popularity, currently has only
      a very minimal number of colorful pieces in their collection. And recently
      when I started asking people what they thought of color, the response was
      always confusion. "What do you mean?" Once, after clarifying, I even got the
      response "distractive." I don't want to say that everyone takes color for
      granted -- there are, after all, people whose livelihood depends on their
      connection with color -- but generally speaking, we rarely do think of color.
    </br>
    </br>
      But maybe the confusion I've received in response to my question isn't
      merely because we tend not to think about color, but rather because we
      wouldn't know how, even if we wanted to, to think about color in such a way
      that it is something in itself, not merely an attribute of something else,
      like the blueness of a chair. <em>Because how do you describe color to someone who
      cannot see?</em> If you said, color is a property, a wavelength, what would
      that even mean? It does not even come close to the beauty of color and the
      things that color can do. If you had to describe color in nonscientific and non
      definitional terms in such a way that color is something
      in itself, then how would you do it? I am reminded of a poem,
      <a href="http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poem/item/20020/auto/0/THE-PROBLEM-OF-DESCRIBING-COLOR"
      target="_blank"><em>The Problem of Describing Color</em></a> by Robert Hass.
      Though his description is not necesarily meant for the blind, Hass has done better than
      most of us probably can: "flecks of poppy in the tar-grass scented summer
      air/ On a wind-struck hillside outside Fano â€“ " What an image. Almost as if
      red is the poppy and not the other way
      around. But Hass' answer is not perfect either as the title of his work would
      suggests.
    </br>
    </br>
      Now I'm not saying that I have the answer and that I know how to think about
      color as something in itself, because I don't. I'm merely suggesting that
      there is more than one way to think about and see color and right now most
      of us are just barely scratching the surface at what there is to see. As the
      artist in Alva Noe's anecdote says, "[W]e see so
      little, when there is so much around us to see," (<em>Strange Tools</em>).
    </br>
    </br>
      My goal in this project is to get people to see a little more, to force an
      awareness of color on them, to see how words can illustrate images that
      evoke emotions that remind us of colors which then turns around and
      feeds those emotions.
