          <p>"If I said fire, if I said blood welling from a cut –
          </br>
          </br>Or flecks of poppy in the tar-grass scented summer air
          </br>On a wind-struck hillside outside Fano –
          </br>
          </br>If I said, her one red earring tugging at her silky lobe,
          </br>
          </br>If she tells fortunes with a deck of fallen leaves
          </br>Until it comes out right –
          </br>
          </br>Rouged nipple, mouth –

          </br>The Giver nodded. "It is. . . When you recieve the memories. You have
            the capacity to see beyond. You'll gain wisdom, then, along with colors.
            And lots more. . ."

          </br>"Why can't everyone see them? Why did colors disappear?"
          </br>
          </br>The Giver shrugged. "Our people made that choice, the choice to go to
            Sameness. . . We relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did
            away with the differences." He thought for a moment. "We gained control of
            many things. But we had to let go of others."</p>

            plodded on. He could remember everything of her save her scent. Seated
            in a theatre with her beside him leaning forward listening to the music.
            Gold scrollwork and sconces and the tall columnar folds of the drapes at
            either side of the stage. She held his hand in her lap and he could feel
            the tops of her stockings through the thin stuff of her summer dress.
            Freeze this frame. Now call down your dark and your cold and be damned.”</p>

          <a id="belovedquote"><p>"Beloved." He said it, but she did not go. She moved
            closer with a footfall he didn't hear and he didn't hear the whisper that
            the flakes of rust made either as they fell away from the seams of his
            tobacco tin. So when the lid gave he didn't know it. What he knew was that
            when he reached the inside part he was saying, "Red heart. Red heart," over
            and over again. Softly and then so loud it woke Denver, then Paul D himself.
            "Red heart. Red heart. Red heart."</p>

            wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into
            loving Daisy. . . Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him
            like a flower and the incarnation was complete.
            </br>
            </br>Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was
            reminded of something — an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I
            had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape
            in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more
            struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and
            what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever."</p>
